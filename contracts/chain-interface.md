# On-chain interface (normative, v1.0)

Purpose: let the Rule Engine (R4, R5), organizations and any auditor read anchors, election state and the registry
**directly from a validator node**, and let organizations and the Rule Engine **submit signed decisions, reviews and
finding records directly**, so that neither detection nor participation depends on the Gateway or Core.
**Pinned chain configuration.** chain_id and contract_address are fixed when the network is set up, confirmed by every
registered organization, and written into the deployment configuration of Core, the Rule Engine and each organization's
client, together with the RPC URL of at least one node run by an organization other than the Gateway operator (D-26).
Readers use only these pinned values. Gateway `GET /v1/chain` (platform, chain_id, contract_address, rpc_urls — one URL
per node) is a convenience: readers compare it with the pinned values and raise a CHAIN_CONFIG_MISMATCH alert (Core
itself, the Rule Engine via POST /internal/v1/audit-alerts) if they differ.

The Solidity interface is normative for the Besu option (D-02 A). For Fabric (D-02 B) the chaincode exposes functions
with the same names, arguments and return fields (JSON). The implementation (Harits) may add functions but must not
change these. `tools/validate_contracts.py` checks that the interface below has no duplicate function names.

## Execution order of approved actions (normative)

1. `executeAction(proposalId)` first (ledger: ADMIN_ACTION_EXECUTED). It marks the proposal executed and opens its
   **effect window**.
2. Then, in the next core seq numbers and before any other system event, the effects of that proposal only:
   ROSTER_AMEND → exactly one `amendRoster` + zero or more `setTokenSetRoot` (one per revoked token);
   TOKEN_REISSUE → one or more `setTokenSetRoot`; WINDOW_CHANGE → exactly one `changeWindow`;
   ELECTION_VOID → exactly one `voidElection`. The window closes at the first system event that is not an effect of that
   proposal; an effect outside its window, a second `amendRoster` / `changeWindow` / `voidElection`, or an effect of a
   proposal of another type is rejected (ALREADY_EXECUTED / INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION).
3. ELECTION_CLOSE_EARLY is the exception: `closeElection(early=true)` comes later, at the effective closed_at, and is
   accepted once for an executed proposal. If it has not been applied one bucket after the effective closed_at, R4 reports
   `missing_effects`.

## Time preconditions

When a call fails only because its block-time condition is not reached yet (`openElection` before windowStart, a
scheduled `closeElection` before closedAt), the contract reverts with `TIME_NOT_REACHED` and the Gateway answers
**RETRY_LATER**, never REJECTED; Core's outbox retries with the same event, so clock skew of a few seconds cannot reject
a boundary transition. If ELECTION_OPENED is nevertheless REJECTED (another cause), Core stays ROSTER_FROZEN, alerts, and
may emit a new ELECTION_OPENED (new event_id and seq) after the cause is fixed, as long as the window has not ended.

## Contract state derived from ledger events (used by Core and R5)

Unset hash fields are `bytes32(0)` on chain and the 64-character string `000…0` in the Gateway API and in R5's derived state.

| Field | Initial value | Set / changed by (ledger event → contract call) |
|---|---|---|
| status | DRAFT | ROSTER_FROZEN, ELECTION_OPENED, ELECTION_CLOSED, TALLY_PUBLISHED, ELECTION_FINALIZED, ELECTION_VOIDED |
| configHash, windowStart, timeBucketSeconds, checkpointIntervalSeconds, orgIds, approvalThreshold, operatorOrgId, proposalTtlHours | from ELECTION_CREATED | never change |
| windowEnd | ELECTION_CREATED.window_end | last accepted WINDOW_CHANGED.new_window_end; ELECTION_CLOSED.closed_at if earlier |
| rosterHash | 0 | ROSTER_FROZEN.roster_hash, then each ROSTER_AMENDED.roster_hash_after |
| tokenSetRoot | 0 | each TOKEN_BATCH_ISSUED / TOKEN_REVOKED .token_set_root |
| resultHash | 0 | TALLY_PUBLISHED.result_hash |
| lastCheckpoint | none | each accepted CHECKPOINT_COMMITTED |

**Creation check.** Right after ELECTION_CREATED is ACCEPTED, Core reads `electionState` and `electionGovernance`
**directly from a validator node** (not through the Gateway), using the pinned chain configuration above (contract
address and the RPC URL of a node not run by the Gateway operator), with the chain-interface getters only. Core
compares the immutable creation fields — configHash, windowStart, windowEnd (still unchanged at this point),
timeBucketSeconds, checkpointIntervalSeconds, orgIds (element by element, both in ascending org_id order), approvalThreshold,
operatorOrgId and proposalTtlHours — with the ELECTION_CREATED payload. Until the check has passed, Core delivers no further
outbox event of the election, and refuses `roster:freeze`, `tokens:issue` and admin-action create/submit with 409
INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION; `Election.creation_check` shows PENDING / PASSED / MISMATCH.
- **Not yet visible ≠ mismatch.** The check starts when ELECTION_CREATED is ACCEPTED or DUPLICATE; both SubmitResults carry
  `tx_hash` and `block_number`. If the pinned node's latest block is lower than `block_number`, Core retries
  (creation_check stays PENDING); if the node is unreachable, Core retries and raises LEDGER_UNAVAILABLE after 60 s.
- **Not found.** If the node has reached `block_number` and `configHash` still reads as 0 (the contract's marker for "no
  such election"; QBFT blocks are final, so this is not a delay) for 60 s, the Gateway's report was wrong: this is
  treated as a mismatch (GOVERNANCE_MISMATCH, detail "not found").
- Only these two cases are a mismatch: values that exist and differ, or not found after the block was reached.
- **Mismatch** → alert (GOVERNANCE_MISMATCH), creation_check = MISMATCH (final): the FIFO cannot be resumed (resumeOutbox
  → 409) and the only exit is to delete the election at Core (`POST /v1/elections/{id}:delete`). The DRAFT record left on
  chain is abandoned: the Gateway account could still append unsigned events to it (I12), but no Core election exists for
  it, so nothing recorded under that ID is an official result; election IDs are never reused. VOID is not used here,
  because its quorum would be computed from the mismatching on-chain governance.

R5 repeats the comparison of the immutable fields at every checkpoint (`governance_mismatch`; windowEnd excluded, it is
covered by `electionStateAtCheckpoint`). So a Gateway that passes other organizations or another threshold to
`createElection` is detected by Core before the roster is frozen and before any approval or review exists, even if the
Gateway's own API reports the expected values.

## Boundary timestamps

A system event scheduled on a boundary (ELECTION_OPENED, scheduled ELECTION_CLOSED, PERIODIC CHECKPOINT_COMMITTED) carries
the **logical boundary time T** as occurred_at, even if Core processes it slightly later; R5's cadence check uses these values.

## Matching of direct submissions

`submitDecision` must carry the stored proposal's actionId, electionId, actionType and targetHash; `submitFindingReview`
must carry the stored record's electionId and findingHash. Any mismatch reverts.

## Trust in the Gateway account

Core system events reach the contract through the Gateway account and are not signed by Core. A dishonest Gateway
operator could therefore inject or pre-empt an unsigned system event (for example call `publishTally` first, which is
allowed only once). Core detects this — every ledger event with source `core` must match an event in Core's outbox by
`event_id` and `payload_hash`, otherwise Core raises an alert and stops the election's FIFO — and R5 compares the
contract's `electionStateAtCheckpoint(k)` (status, windowEnd, rosterHash, tokenSetRoot, resultHash) with the ledger
events up to its lastCoreSeq, which catches a Gateway calling the contract with arguments that differ from the events — but neither prevents it;
recovery is ELECTION_VOID. This trust assumption is listed in threat-model I12 and D-26.

## Indexing by the Gateway

The Gateway turns chain events into ledger events: `ProposalDecided` → APPROVAL_RECORDED, `FindingRecorded` →
FINDING_RECORDED, `FindingReviewed` → FINDING_REVIEWED (payload `submitted_via: chain` when the transaction did not come
from the Gateway). Directly submitted reviews have no reviewer_id or note text; the organization may later attach the note
through Core (`PATCH /v1/findings/{id}/review` with the same signature), which checks `H(note) = note_hash`.

## How R5 uses it

**Chain state comparison.** R5 at checkpoint k reads `electionStateAtCheckpoint(electionId, k)` — the state the contract stored
when CHECKPOINT_COMMITTED k was applied — and compares it with the state implied by the ledger's core events with
seq ≤ that snapshot's `lastCoreSeq` (status, windowEnd, rosterHash, tokenSetRoot, resultHash). Later chain progress
therefore never causes a mismatch, and re-running an old checkpoint gives the same answer.

For every anchor of the election: read `anchorAt` from the pinned node ("Pinned chain configuration"; `rpc_urls` from the
Gateway only for comparison), recompute `merkle_root` from `GET /v1/anchors/{id}/leaves` + the events and `rejections_root` from
`GET /v1/rejections`, and compare with the on-chain values. Any difference → R5 FAIL. No node reachable → INCONCLUSIVE
(`NODE_UNAVAILABLE`).
